The project aimed to solve general issues faced by gas agencies. Most of the gas agencies rely on third party UPI apps for booking household and commercial gas cylinders. These Third party UPI apps incur platform fee which increases the cost for the cylinder.
The project eliminates the use of third party apps and reduces extra charges.
